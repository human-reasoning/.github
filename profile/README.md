## About Us
Welcome to the GitHub home of the Laboratory for Human Reasoning. We are a 🔬 cognitive neuroscience lab dedicated to understanding the neural basis of human 🤔 reasoning and 🔗 association.

We use 🧩 cognitive tasks coupled with 🧠 neural and 👁️ behavioral recordings to investigate phenomena like 🔎 logical inference and 🎯 strategic planning. If you've ever wondered how the mind thinks its way through a game of ♟️ chess, so do we!
